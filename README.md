# CogDL-TensorFlow
```CogDL-TensorFlow```: The TensorFlow Implementation of [CogDL](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/cogdl/). With Support from Professor [Jie Tang](https://weibo.com/jietangthu).

# CogDL
![CogDL](docs/source/_static/cogdl-logo.png)

```CogDL``` is a graph representation learning toolkit that allows researchers and developers to easily train and compare baseline or custom models for node classification, link prediction and other tasks on graphs. It provides implementations of many popular models, including: 
 * non-GNN Baselines like Deepwalk, LINE, NetMF;
 * GNN Baselines like GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE.

## Getting Started

## Requirements and Installation

- TensorFlow version >= 2.0.0
- Python version >= 3.6

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

You can use `python scripts/train.py --task example_task --dataset example_dataset --model example_method` to run example_method on example_data and evaluate it via example_task.
